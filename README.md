# Work-Day-Scheduling-Assistant

## Description

The Work Day Scheduling Assistant was created to cater to the career professional who struggles with organizing their work day.  The assistant is a calendar tool that drills down to the actual day with separated time blocks for events both large and small.  Each day, you can start with a clean template that allows you to manage your day at a glance.  

The assistant allows user input into each time block and once the save button is clicked, you are able to return to this assistant and view the saved entry at any point.  Color coding of each time block introduces visual cues and stimuli so that the user is able to easily recognize past, present, and future events.

## Roadmap
Future Improvements:
1. More personalized functions to allow the user to set their own preferences for the appearance of the page.
2. A button that clears the contents of the previous day so that a new template is not required every day.
3. The ability to slide open and closed each time block so that you can break the hour down by quarter hour sections.
4. An extension that would allow the user to merge this scheduler with their current work calendar.
